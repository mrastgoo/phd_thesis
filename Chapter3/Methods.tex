\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:chp3-sec4}
Figure~\ref{fig:dermoscopyFramework} shows our proposed framework for automatic detection of malignant melanoma.
As shown in the figure, the framework consists of 6 main stages according to our concept of the general classification framework (see Fig.~\ref{fig:GCF}).
These stages are explained in the following.
