\caption[A list of melanoma and dysplastic lesions in the \ac{dos}-balanced training, Experiment~\#2]{
	A list of melanoma and dysplastic lesions in the training, testing and validation sets of each subset. 
	10 different subsets were created by randomly selecting \#~lesions from the dataset. 
	If a melanoma lesion was selected to be a part of a specific group, its two deformed synthetic samples were also included in that set.}
