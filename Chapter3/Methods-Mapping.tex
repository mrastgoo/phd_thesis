\subsection{Mapping}\label{chp3-subsec2}
The mapping stage is used to determine a discrete set of elements (or structures) used for the representation of each image/sample.
Therefore, two mapping strategies are defined: (i) \emph{global} and (ii) \emph{local} mapping.
In the global mapping approach, a single structure is computed for each image while in the local mapping, a set of structures is defined by sliding a window across the image.
The final descriptor is then computed based on a single element or a concatenation of elements resulting from the sliding window.
The features used to create single or multiple elements are described in the following section.
