This section presents a summary of the algorithms for dermoscopic lesion classification proposed in the past decade.
Graphically, this summary is described in Table~\ref{tab:dermoscopy_Feature} and Fig.~\ref{fig:dermoscopy_Sens_PerformanceComparison}.

In 2001, Merler~et al.\,\cite{merler2001tuning} proposed a cost-sensitive boosting approach for classification of melanoma (M) against benign (B) lesions, where they report a \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 97\% and 54\%, respectively.
They used a dataset, called ``MEDS'', which contained 152 lesions, including 42 melanoma.

In another study, Kreutz~et al.\,\cite{kreutz2001automated} presented a classification framework of M~vs.~B lesions, on a dataset of 423 dermoscopic lesions.
In this study, the authors proposed a segmentation approach based on color clustering and a region growing technique. 
Using \acf{mlp} and features such as color statistics, shape and Gabor features, they reported a \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 98.7$\%$ and 76.5$\%$, respectively.

In the same year, Dreiseitl~et al.\,\cite{dreiseitl2001comparison} reported a comparison of different classifiers (kernel \ac{svm}, k-\ac{nn}, \ac{ann}, and \acf{dt}) on a dataset of 1619 lesions, among which 105 lesions were melanoma.
This comparison of M~vs.~B+D (Dysplastic) lesion classification methods reported that the best \ac{se} (92.05$\%$ ) and \ac{sp} (94.97$\%$) was achieved with the kernel \ac{svm}.

Ganster~et al.\,\cite{ganster2001automated} proposed an automated melanoma recognition framework using a very large dataset of 5363 lesions, including 96 melanoma.
The authors proposed to segment lesions based on a fusion method of several thresholding stages.
Using k-\ac{nn} classifier and multiclass classification, the results for \ac{se} and \ac{sp} were 87$\%$ and 92$\%$, respectively.

Rubegni~et al.\,\cite{rubegni2002automated} also proposed an automated diagnosis framework for pigmented lesions, where they used \ac{ann} with shape and color statistics to differentiate M~vs.~B lesions.
Classifying on a dataset of 588 lesions, including 217 melanomas, the authors reported a \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 99$\%$ and 92.6$\%$, respectively.

Later, Sboner~et al.\,\cite{sboner2003multiple} proposed an ensemble approach for classification of M~vs.~B lesions.
Their algorithm on a dataset of 152 lesions, containing 42 melanomas, achieved a \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 81$\%$ and 74$\%$, respectively.

Burroni~et al.\,\cite{burroni2005dysplastic} proposed an algorithm for differentiation of M~vs.~D lesions.
In their method, the authors segmented 174 lesions using Laplacian filter and zero-crossing algorithm. 
Using the extracted shape, color statistics, and \ac{glcm} features and the stepwise discriminant analysis as the classifier~\cite{burroni2005dysplastic}, they obtained a \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 71$\%$ and 75$\%$, respectively. 

\input{Chapter3/Table1.tex}

Similar features were used later in \cite{celebi2007methodological}.
In their framework, the authors proposed segmenting lesions using the region growing and merging algorithm with a color similarity constraint.
Their experiments for classification of M~vs.~B+D lesions using kernel \ac{svm}, on a dataset of 564 lesions containing 88 melanomas, achieved a \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 92.34$\%$ and 93.33$\%$, respectively.

Iyatomi~et al.\,\cite{iyatomi2008improved} proposed a \ac{cad} system for recognition of M~vs.~B+D lesions.

The authors segmented lesions using a region growing algorithm and classified some shape, color and texture (\ac{glcm}) features, which resemble the ``ABCD'' characteristics, with an \ac{ann} classifier.
They reported that on a large dataset of 1258 lesions including 198 melanomas their algorithm achieved a \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 85.9$\%$ and 86$\%$, respectively.


Situ~et al.\,\cite{situ2008malignant} proposed to represent extracted features, using \ac{bow} approach.
Classifying texture features such as wavelet and Gabor by using \ac{svm} classifier and \ac{bow} representation, the authors reported the \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 88.8$\%$ and 69.26$\%$, respectively.
This study was dedicated for differentiation of M~vs.~B+D lesions on a dataset of 100 lesions, containing 30 melanoma.
The author later, proposed another segmentation method using graph cut algorithm~\cite{situ2010modeling}.
In the later study, using the same framework, they used color, \ac{sift} and wavelet features instead.
Reporting their results on the same dataset, they achieved \ac{se} of 83$\%$ and \ac{sp} of 80.93$\%$. 

Another computerized framework was proposed by Capdehourat~et al.\,\cite{capdehourat2009pigmented} for classification of M~vs.~B+D lesions on a dataset of 433 lesions among which 80 lesions were melanoma.
Here the authors used Dullrazor~\cite{Lee1997} algorithm for hair removal and proposed to segment the lesions using color thresholding based on Otsu approach.
Using color statistics and texture features of \ac{glcm} and Gabor filters, and \ac{adb} classifier, they achieved \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 95$\%$ and 91.25$\%$, respectively.
They also proposed to use \ac{smote} balancing algorithm to deal with imbalance data distribution.
Using the same pre-processing and the same framework on a larger dataset (544 lesions containing 111 melanoma), they later achieved \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 90$\%$ and 77$\%$, respectively~\cite{capdehourat2011toward}. 

Combination of \ac{svm} and \ac{bow} representation was also used by \cite{zortea2010automatic} to differentiate M~vs.~B lesions, on a dataset of 164 lesions (including 80 melanoma).
Using \ac{bow} representation of \ac{lbp} features, the author proposed to eliminate the segmentation stage and achieved \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 73$\%$ ad 73$\%$, respectively.
Later using a larger dataset (206 lesions containing 37 melanoma), the author proposed a framework for classification of M~vs.B+D, based on shape, color and texture features which mimic the ``ABCD'' characteristics~\cite{zortea2014performance}.
In this work, using feature selection techniques and \acf{qda} classifier, their best performance was reported with \ac{se} of 86$\%$ and \ac{sp} of 52$\%$. 

\acl{svm} classifier was also used by \cite{gilmore2010support} for automatic recognition of M~vs.~D lesions.
In this work the author propose to extract color statistics and shape features from the entire image without considering segmentation step.
They later used \ac{pca} to reduce the feature dimensions and achieved \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 89$\%$ and 64$\%$.

In another work, Garnavi~et al.\,\cite{garnavi2012computer} proposed a \ac{cad} system for classification of M~vs.~B lesions.
In this study the author compared manual and adaptive thresholding approach for segmentation of the lesions.
As for feature extraction they proposed to combine wavelet package features and shape statistics.
They also provided a comparison between \ac{svm}, \ac{rf}, \ac{lmt}, and hidden \ac{nb} classifiers, where the best \ac{acc} of 88.30$\%$ was achieved with \ac{rf} classifier.

Abbas~et al.\,\cite{abbas2012computer} proposed another \ac{cad} system for detection of M~vs.~B+D lesions.
In this framework the authors proposed their own hair removal~\cite{Abbas2011a}, and segmentation~\cite{Abbas2012} algorithm.
Using \ac{svm} classifier and features such as \ac{lbp}, wavelet, and color statistics, the author reported \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 91.46$\%$ and 94.14$\%$, respectively, on relatively small dataset of 120 lesions (containing 20 melanoma).
Using the same framework, they later reported their results on a different dataset of 120 lesions, which contains 60 melanoma~\cite{abbas2013melanoma}.
On this dataset, they achieved \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 88.2$\%$ and 91.3$\%$, respectively.

Barata~et al.\,\cite{barata2013two,barata2013role}, and ruela~et al.\,\cite{ruela2013role,ruela2013color} recently represented their works on different subsets of PH$^{2}$ dataset~\cite{mendoncca2013ph}.
In these works the authors compared the role of shape and colors~\cite{ruela2013role,ruela2013color} for detection of M~vs.~B+D lesions using \ac{adb} classifier.
In \cite{barata2013two,barata2013towards}, they proposed to use \ac{bow} representation of colors and gradient features.
Their results comparing different classifiers, such as \ac{adb}, kernel \ac{svm}, and k-\ac{nn}, indicated that combination of \ac{bow} representation and k-\ac{nn} classifier achieved the best performance with \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 100$\%$ and 75$\%$, respectively.

The recent studies on automated melanoma recognition were presented by \cite{schaefer2014ensemble,Celebi2015}.
Schaefer~et al.\,\cite{schaefer2014ensemble} proposed a M~vs.~B+D classification framework, using a dataset of 564 lesions, among which 88 lesions were melanoma.
The author chose \ac{smote} sampling to avoid imbalance problem and used ensemble approaches to perform the classification.
Using shape, color and \ac{glcm} features, they achieved \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 93.76$\%$ and 93.84$\%$, respectively.
Shimizu~et al.\,\cite{Celebi2015} tackled a multiclass problem of melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, seborrheic keratosis, and dysplactic nevus.
They proposed to use an ensemble approach for classifying each group on a dataset of 964 lesions which contains 109 melanoma.
In this study by using color and \ac{glcm} features the \ac{se} of 90.48$\%$ for melanoma lesions were achieved.

The aforementioned studies are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:dermoscopy_Sens_PerformanceComparison} and Table.~\ref{tab:dermoscopy_Feature}.
%and Table.~\ref{tab:dermoscopy_Classifiers}.

Figure.~\ref{fig:dermoscopy_Sens_PerformanceComparison} categorizes the methods in terms of their dataset size, their classification scope (M~vs.~B, M~vs.~B~+~D, and M~vs.~D) and their achieved results (\ac{se} and \ac{sp}).
In this figure, beside mentioning the ratio of melanoma samples over the total size of the dataset, a categorization of different datasets is presented as well.
Here the datasets with less than 100 lesions are categorized as group~1, datasets with more than 100 and less than 200 lesions are categorized as group~2, dataset with less than 500 lesions belong to group~3 and dataset with over 500 lesions and less than 1000 lesions are categorized as group~4 and finally any dataset over 1000 lesion is categorized as group~5.
\input{Chapter3/Figure1.tex}
Table~\ref{tab:dermoscopy_Feature} categorizes the proposed studies in terms of their choice of extracted features.
In this table, the references which chose \ac{bow} representation of the extracted features are highlighted in \textbf{bold}.
\input{Chapter3/Table1.tex}
%Table~\ref{tab:dermoscopy_classifiers} categorized the 

Based on our studies of the state of the art methods, we reached to several findings which are listed in the following:
\textbf{
\begin{enumerate}[i]
\item Features such as color, shape, and often \ac{glcm} are used extensively compared to others. 
Although, these features are used to represent similar characteristics to ``ABCD'' rule, the lack of using well-known pattern recognition features is evident.
\item Different machine learning techniques are used to perform classification. However the choice of ensemble was limited to few studies.
\item Normally the used datasets are imbalanced and in some cases highly imbalanced~\cite{ganster2001automated}.
However balancing techniques are rarely used to reduce the bias of the classifier.
\item As it is highlighted in Fig.~\ref{fig:dermoscopy_Sens_PerformanceComparison}, few methods were proposed for classification of M~.vs~D lesions.
Classification of M against D lesions is more challenging due to the characteristic similarities between the lesions.
This is a challenging task for both dermatologists and automated algorithms compared to differentiation of M~.vs~B lesions, which is more straight forward for the dermatologists.
\item Finally, although some methods achieved very good results, it is impossible to offer a fair comparison among the aforementioned methods, since their performance are reported using different datasets.
Subsequently it is not possible to draw a conclusion for the performance of machine learning techniques in classification of melanoma lesions.
\end{enumerate}}
Keeping these conclusions in mind, we propose our \ac{cad} system for classification of melanoma lesions, which is discussed in great details in the rest of the chapter.

In this study, the authors applied a global and adaptive thresholding approach for lesion segmentation \textcolor{red}{((!) the paper says they used manually segmented lesions)}.
As for feature extraction, they combined wavelet package features with shape statistics.
The paper also provided a comparison between \ac{svm}, \ac{rf}, \ac{lmt}, and hidden \ac{nb} classifiers, where the best \ac{acc} of 88.30$\%$ was achieved with the \ac{rf} classifier.

In these works, the authors compared the role of shape and color descriptors~\cite{ruela2013role,ruela2013color} for the detection of M~vs.~B+D lesions using the \ac{adb} classifier.
In \cite{barata2013two,barata2013towards}, they proposed to use the \ac{bow} representation of color and gradient features.
Their results comparing the \ac{adb}, kernel \ac{svm}, and k-\ac{nn} classifiers indicated that the combination of the \ac{bow} representation and k-\ac{nn} classifier achieved the best performance with a \ac{se} and \ac{sp} of 100$\%$ and 75$\%$, respectively.
