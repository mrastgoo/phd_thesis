\section{Optical Properties of Medium}\label{sec:chp4-sec4}

Besides the nature of the light and polarized states of incident light, we are interested in checking the polarized properties of the optical elements and subjected materials.
In this regard, this section is dedicated to describing the optical properties of the medium and their formulation.
%Mueller matrix is used to describe the transfer function and interaction of any medium with polarized light.
%In the previous section, we explained the polarization state of the the light through Stokes parameters.
%In this section, we describe the transfer function and interaction of any medium with polarized light using Mueller matrix. 
%%In this section, we present the Mueller matrix which describes the transfer function of any medium in its interaction with polarized light.

%A medium can possesses similar properties than optical elements to change the polarization states of the incident light.
%A medium can contain depolarization, birefringence (retardants) and diattenuation properties. 

%	\begin{description}
%	\item[Depolarization] - If an initial state of the light is 100$\%$ polarized and polarization degree of the existing state is less than unity, the system posses the depolarization property. Depolarization is usually encountered due to multiple scattering of photons.
%	The general form of a pure depolarization Mueller matrix is shown in Eq.\ref{Eq:DepolarizationMul}.
%	Here $1-\vert a \vert$ and $1-\vert b \vert$ are depolarization factors for linear polarization states and $1-\vert c \vert$ represents depolarization factor for circular polarization. The net depolarization factor is shown in Eq. \ref{Eq:netDepolarizationfac}
%	\begin{equation}\label{Eq:DepolarizationMul}
%	\small
%		M_{\Delta} = \begin{bmatrix}
%	1 & & 0 & & 0 & & 0\\0 && a && 0 && 0\\ 0 && 0 && b && 0\\ 0 && 0 && 0 && c
%	\end{bmatrix} , \hspace{1 cm} \vert a \vert, \vert b \vert, \vert c \vert \leq 1
%	\end{equation}
%	\begin{equation}\label{Eq:netDepolarizationfac}
%	\small
%		\Delta  = 1 - \frac{\vert a \vert + \vert b \vert + \vert c \vert }{3} = 1 - \frac{\vert tr (M_{\Delta}-1)\vert}{3} , \hspace{0.5 cm} 0\leq \Delta \leq 1
%		\end{equation}		
%	\item[Retardance] - is the phase shift between orthogonal components of polarized light and it occurs due to differences in refractive indices of different polarized states. 
%	
%	Birefringence is a linear retardants which occurs due to phase difference between orthogonal linear polarization states (between vertical and horizontal or between $45^{\circ}$ and $-45^{\circ}$ ).
%	Mueller matrix of linear retardance ($\delta$) while its fast axis is rotated by angle $\theta$ with respect to the horizontal axis is shown in Eq.\ref{Eq:Birefringence}
%	\begin{equation}\label{Eq:Birefringence}
%	\small
%	M_{R_{B}}=\begin{bmatrix}
%	1 &&  0 &&  0  && 0\\
%	0 && \cos^{2}2\theta +\sin^{2}2\theta\cos\delta && \sin 2\theta\cos 2\theta(1-\cos\delta) &&  -\sin 2\theta \sin \delta\\ 
%	0 &&\sin 2\theta\cos 2\theta(1-\cos\delta) && \sin^{2}2\theta +\cos^{2}2\theta\cos\delta && \cos 2\theta \sin \delta\\
%	 0 && \sin 2\theta \sin \delta && -\cos 2\theta \sin \delta && \cos\delta
%	\end{bmatrix}
%	\end{equation}	

%	Beside linear retardance, there is circular retardance $\psi$ (optical rotation) as well, which arises due to phase difference between right circularly polarized (RCP) and left circularly polarized (LCP) states. 
%	The Mueller matrix for a circular retardance is shown in Eq.\ref{Eq:CircularRet}.
%	\begin{equation}\label{Eq:CircularRet}
%	\small
%	M_{R_{C}}=\begin{bmatrix}
%	1 &&  0 &&  0  && 0\\
%	0 && \cos 2\psi && -\sin 2\psi &&  0\\ 
%	0 && \sin 2\psi && \cos 2\psi && 0\\
%	 0 && 0 && 0 && 1
%	\end{bmatrix}
%	\end{equation}
%	
%	\item[Diattenuation ($d$)] - of an optical elements corresponds to differential attenuation (absorption and scattering) of orthogonal polarizations for both linear and circular polarizations states.
%	Accordingly linear diattenuation is defined as differential attenuation of two orthogonal linear polarization states and circular diattenuation is defined as differential attenuation of RCP and LCP.
%	Mueller matrix of linear diattenuator is defined in Eq.\ref{Eq:LinearDiattenuation}. 
%	Here two intensity transmittance (reflectance) parameters ($q$, $r$) are used for orthogonal states and $\theta$ is the orientation angle of principal axis. 
%	
%	\begin{equation}\label{Eq:LinearDiattenuation}
%	\small
%	M_{D}=\begin{bmatrix}
%	q+r &&  (q-r)\cos 2\theta &&  (q-r)\sin 2\theta && 0\\
%	(q-r)\cos 2\theta && (q+r)\cos^{2}2\theta + 2\sqrt{(qr)}\sin^{2}2\theta && (q+r-2\sqrt{(qr)})\sin 2\theta\cos 2\theta & & 0\\ 
%	(q-r)\sin 2\theta && (q+r-2\sqrt{(qr)})\sin 2\theta\cos 2\theta && (q+r)\cos^{2}2\theta + 2\sqrt{(qr)}\sin^{2}2\theta && 0\\
%	 0 && 0 && 0 && 2\sqrt{(qr)}
%	\end{bmatrix}
%	\end{equation}		
%	\end{description}

A medium (tissue) can possess different optical properties at the same time.
In order to obtain these properties, inverse polarimetry based on Mueller matrix decomposition is used.
The Lu-Chipman decomposition method \cite{lu1996interpretation} is a well known inverse polarimetry analysis explained in the following.

%you can mention that there is technics than can estimates or measure the Mueller matrix of a medium and then it is sometimes useful to decompose the measured matrix in order to deduce the physical properties of the medium.}
