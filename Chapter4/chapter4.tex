\section{Conclusion}
The basics of polarization, how to exploit polarization and its parameters in bio-imaging and skin screening and the recent state of the art techniques were discussed. 
It was shown that partial or full Stokes and Mueller polarimetry allow screening which is of main interest. 
However as it was discussed, Mueller and full polarimetry systems are difficult to adjust for in-vivo screening. 
Therefore as the first step, we consider to exploit partial polarimetry and develop our \ac{pd} accordingly.
This device is further explained in Chap.\,\ref{chp:chapter5}.

%%In this chapter we presented the basics of polarization, different approaches of empoloying polarization and polarized parameters in bioimaging and
