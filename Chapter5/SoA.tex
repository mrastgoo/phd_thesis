\chapter{State of the Art}

Meglinski and Matcher 2002 : 
Simulated difuse reflectance spectra of skin by assuming wavelength independent scattering coefficient for the differnt skin tissues and using the known wavelength dependece of the absorption coefficinet of oxy and de-oxyhaemoglobin and water. 
Stocasthic monte carlo is used to convert wavelength dependent absorption and wavelength independent scattering coefficient into reflected intensity.
Blood concentration used in simulations [0.04 0.3]
Water concentration used in simulation [0.05 0.7]
scattering coefficient [5 100]
g [0.75 0.95]

Meglinski and Matcher 2003: 
Skin has a complex multilayered non-homogeneous structure with a spatially varying absorption coefficient. \textbf{copy, same as previous article mostly}

Krishnaswamy and Baranoski 2004: 
spectrarl simulations of light interaction with human skin.
A simulated model that counts for surface reflectance, subsurface reflectance and transimittance, and light absorption.
