\section{Conclusion}
This Chapter presented a broad-view of different aspects of machine learning and classification.
It also discusses, the most used and well-known techniques of each steps and the flow of the classification framework.
It is important to notice that the choice of different techniques in each step is application dependent and the best configuration is mostly found emprically.
Next chapters presents our proposed frameworks, where different techniques are employed in each step.
