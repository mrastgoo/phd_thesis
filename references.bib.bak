  Abstract                 = {Melanoma is a malignant skin tumour. If detected and surgically removed early whilst residing in the superficial part of the skin the prognosis is excellent. A seven-point check-list of signs and symptoms has been adopted by the Cancer Research Campaign to help non-dermatologists distinguish benign pigmented lesions from melanoma. The presence of irregularity in shape or outline of a mole is one of these important signs. However, it has recently been shown that not only patients, but also clinicians have difficulty in agreeing upon whether a mole exhibits irregularity or not. Computer image analysis methods have been developed to derive quantitative measures of those shape parameters which dermatologists appear to use in their assessment of shape irregularity. The overall shape of the lesion is expressed by the [`]bulkiness' measure. Irregularity of the border is expressed by two fractal dimension measures, one for the [`]structural' aspect of the shape and the other for the [`]textural' aspect. These measures were used in combination to classify melanomas in the study containing silhouettes of 43 melanomas and 45 benign lesions producing correct classification with 91% sensitivity and 69% specificity. This paper describes computer image analysis aspects of the study.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Melanoma is completely curable if resected early. Unfortunately, early melanoma can be difficult to differentiate from other pigmented lesions. Computerized image analysis instruments have now been developed to assist in determining whether a pigmented lesion is potentially dangerous and requires biopsy. To evaluate whether one such instrument can improve the management of pigmented lesions, we obtained biopsy specimens from 52 pigmented lesions that appeared clinically benign to an experienced dermatologist but were suspicious by image analysis. Observation Histologically, 9 (17%) of the lesions that were removed based solely on computer recommendation were potentially dangerous and should have been removed. These included 1 malignant melanoma in situ and 8 dysplastic nevi with moderate to severe cytologic atypia. Conclusion The results of the present study indicate that computerized image analysis can improve the evaluation of pigmented skin lesions by identifying clinically unsuspicious, but potentially dangerous, lesions that might have otherwise have been neglected.},
